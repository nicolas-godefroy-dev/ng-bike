I want you to act as a Senior Frontend developer. 
Do not write explanations. 

Write tests with jest in typescript for the component below.

All test cases must be wrapped in a describe block.
The describe must be the component name formatted like this "<ComponentName />".
Prefer "it" to "test" for test cases.
All test cases must start with "expect.hasAssertions();" to ensure that at least one assertion is made.
